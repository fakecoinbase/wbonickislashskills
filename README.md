# skills
This repository contains files which show my skills in Python and in data analysis. So far all is written in jupyter notebook.

There are three folders:
1. Lottery - it contains a file where historical results of polish lottery game are examinated in order to find out if it is possible to create a system of selecting numbers that increase chance of winning a prize. At the end of the notebook some statistical calculations are performed and figures are shown
2. PrzedsiÄ™biorstwa - a little project which goal was to find out which businesses have been suffering the most due to covid19 panic (in Polish market, 60 days (march and april 2020). Description in polish.
3. Bitcoin price prediction - a project which goal is to:
 - evaluate relationship between the price of bitcoin, market assets (gold price, S&P500 index etc.) and features directly connected to bitcoin (google search trends etc.)
 - build a reliable model for predicting the price of bitcoin
So far regression and tree-based models are built. __This project is still in progress.__
