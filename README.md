This repository contains files which show my skills in Python and in data analysis. So far all is written in jupyter notebook

There are three folders:
1. Lottery - it contains a file where historical results of polish lottery game are examinated in order to find out if it is possible to create a system of selecting numbers that increase chance of winning a prize. At the end of the notebook some statistical calculations are performed and figures are plotted
